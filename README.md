# Data-Analyst-Projects
This repository contains a collection of Data Analytics projects that I have worked on. Each project includes the source code and the dataset used for analysis.

The projects cover a range of topics in Data Analytics, including exploratory data analysis, data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning. Some of the projects include:

* Analysis of Sales Data: In this project, I analyzed sales data to identify trends and patterns in sales over time. I used various techniques such as data visualization and time series analysis to gain insights into the data.

* Predicting Employee Attrition: In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict which employees are most likely to leave the company. I used various classification algorithms such as logistic regression and decision trees to build the model.

* Exploratory Analysis of Customer Reviews: In this project, I analyzed customer reviews of a product to identify common themes and sentiment. I used natural language processing techniques to extract insights from the text.

The code in this repository is written in Python and includes Jupyter notebooks for each project. The datasets used for analysis are included in the repository as well.

Feel free to explore the projects and use the code as a reference for your own Data Analytics projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to raise an issue or contact me directly at saqibiqbal27772@gmail.com
